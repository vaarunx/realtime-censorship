A cross-browser extension that uses deep learning to detect and redact NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content in real-time, providing a safer browsing experience for users in professional, educational, or family environments.

## üìã Abstract

The sudden growth and scale of the internet make it impossible to have a central authority to control the content being shared. Internet companies like Meta have community guidelines for policing the content uploaded to their site. However, this is restricted to their respective platforms, and the internet is much broader. While other forms of media like television have a clearly defined system for censorship, there is a vacuum in the tech world in protecting users from being exposed to sensitive content. 

The work proposes to build a deep learning model that classifies the contents of a webpage as Safe or Not safe for work (NSFW) using techniques such as image classification and sentiment analysis. NSFW content is anything deemed inappropriate in a public setting, including age-restricted content. The end product would be a cross-browser web extension that can detect and classify content as safe or NSFW in real time and redact the said content from being displayed in the client's browser. A web extension would be a universal and easy-to-use solution for the user to protect themselves from sensitive content on the internet.

## üéØ Problem Statement

With an estimated 64 Zettabytes of data on the internet, it's impossible to have centralized content control. Key challenges include:

- **Unfiltered Content**: Most websites lack content filtering mechanisms
- **Child Safety**: Children can easily access inappropriate content despite safety mechanisms
- **Professional Environments**: NSFW content can appear unexpectedly in workplace settings
- **Content Creator Risks**: Streamers face platform bans due to accidental exposure to inappropriate content
- **Exponential Growth**: NSFW content has been growing exponentially since the inception of the web

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç Real-Time Content Detection
- **Text Classification**: Multi-label classification for toxic, obscene, insulting, threatening, and hate speech content
- **Image Classification**: NSFW image detection using convolutional neural networks
- **Live Processing**: Real-time analysis of web page content as you browse

### üõ°Ô∏è Smart Filtering
- **Selective Redaction**: Blurs or removes inappropriate content while preserving safe material
- **Multi-Category Detection**: Identifies various types of inappropriate content including:
  - **Toxic**: Nasty, disrespectful comments likely to cause users to quit conversations
  - **Obscene**: Content violating accepted moral norms, depicting sex offensively
  - **Insult**: Crude or offensive statements intended to hurt or offend
  - **Identity Hate**: Attacks based on religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, etc.
  - **Severe Toxic**: More severe toxic content that attacks personal identity
  - **Threat**: Declarations of harm or unfavorable consequences

### üåê Universal Compatibility
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Ad Blocking**: Built-in ad blocker for enhanced user experience
- **Privacy-First**: Client-side scraping with cloud-based processing for optimal privacy

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Data Tier**: Web scraping and data preprocessing
2. **Model Tier**: Deep learning models for text and image classification  
3. **Application Tier**: Browser extension and cloud backend

### Data Flow Overview

![Level 0 Data Flow Diagram](res/data-flow-diagram.jpg)
*Figure 3.2: Level 0 Data Flow Diagram*

The user downloads and installs the browser extension from their preferred browser's store. The extension scrapes the website being accessed and sends it to the backend application, which performs preprocessing and runs the optimized model to classify whether the data is sensitive or not. The application passes this data back to the browser extension which renders the page with only the safe content.
